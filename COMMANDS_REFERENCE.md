## 🚀 COMMANDS TO RUN THE MODELS

### Option 1: Run Complete Pipeline (Recommended)
```bash

cd /Users/krishmalvia/Desktop/pms-models

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the complete pipeline
cd src
python run_pipeline_simple.py
```

**Expected Runtime:** 10-15 minutes  
**What it does:**
1. Loads and preprocesses data (532 employees, 40 tasks)
2. Generates skill embeddings using sentence-transformers
3. Trains suitability model (LightGBM with Optuna tuning)
4. Trains workload prediction model (LightGBM regressor)
5. Optimizes task assignments using ILP
6. Generates metrics report

## 💡 USE TRAINED MODELS

### Load and Use Suitability Model
```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd

# Load model
model_pkg = joblib.load('models/suitability_model.pkl')
model = model_pkg['model']
feature_names = model_pkg['feature_names']

# Predict
# predictions = model.predict(X_new)
```

### Load and Use Workload Model
```python
import joblib

# Load model
model_pkg = joblib.load('models/workload_model.pkl')
model = model_pkg['model']

# Predict hours
# predicted_hours = model.predict(X_new)
```

---

## 🔄 RE-TRAIN MODELS

If you want to re-train with different parameters:

```bash
cd /Users/krishmalvia/Desktop/pms-models
source venv/bin/activate
cd src

# Delete old models (optional)
rm -f ../models/*.pkl

# Run pipeline again
python run_pipeline_simple.py
```

---

## ⚙️ CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

### Change Hyperparameter Tuning Trials
Edit `run_pipeline_simple.py`:
```python
# Line 44: Change n_trials
train_suitability_model(X, y, use_optuna=True, n_trials=50)  # Default: 30

# Line 70: Change n_trials  
train_workload_model(X_work, y_work, use_optuna=True, n_trials=50)  # Default: 30
```

### Change Max Tasks Per Employee
Edit `run_pipeline_simple.py`:
```python
# Line 94: Change max_tasks_per_employee
assignments_df = optimize_assignments(
    pairs_df, 
    employee_df, 
    task_df,
    method='ilp',
    max_tasks_per_employee=3  # Default: 2
)
```

### Change Assignment Method
```python
# Use Hungarian Algorithm (faster, 1-to-1 matching)
method='hungarian'

# Use ILP (slower, allows multiple tasks per employee)
method='ilp'
```

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Virtual Environment Deactivates
```bash
cd /Users/krishmalvia/Desktop/pms-models
source venv/bin/activate
```

### If Models Are Missing
```bash
ls -lh models/
# If empty, run the pipeline again
cd src
python run_pipeline_simple.py
```

### If Outputs Are Missing
```bash
ls -lh outputs/
# If empty, the pipeline didn't complete
# Check for errors in the terminal output
```

### Memory Issues
```bash
# Reduce Optuna trials
# Edit run_pipeline_simple.py
# Change n_trials from 30 to 10
```
